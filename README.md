What is the average demographic of a person and activities on the app? (ex. Age, country/city, time) - Jason

All metrics include demographics from countries with 100 or more users. The average age across the four nations ranged from 21.5 to 22.5, reflecting that the app is most popular among individuals in their early 20s. The app was most popular in Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, and Italy, in that order. Notably, the top eight user cities were located in Switzerland and the Netherlands. It appears the app is gradually gaining traction in mainland Europe, though its relatively low popularity in Germany remains unexplained.
Another key observation is the distribution of users’ “last time online.” Peak usage hours occur from 11 AM, between 2 PM and 4 PM, and again from 6 PM to 7 PM. This suggests two possible behaviors: users may be engaging with the app during lunch breaks and after work hours, or they may be using it to coordinate plans with potential dates.

Does people who speak more languages have a higher chance of getting a match? - Kaifeng

In lovoo_v3 dataset there are a total of 878 verified users, 86 of them can speak two or more languages. Through investigation, we discovered that for users who can speak more languages they also tend to have more fans, profile visits, and kisses. This can be demonstrate by the positive correlation coefficients, the correlation coefficient between number of languages the user can speak versus number of kisses they received is 0.113287, for profile visits is 0.101532, and for fans is 0.07526. However, each correlation coefficient indicates a weak strength relationship. Therefore we can conclude that speaking more languages may not have a higher chance of getting a match, there is no direct influence. And to discover why this is happening, we find out that users who can speak more languages is more interest of making friends than dating, among 86 multi language users around 71% of them interested in making friend while only 43% interested in dating.

How does the number of profile pictures influence the number of profile visits on a dating app like Lovoo? With profiles with less pics , how did that affect their matches ? Belkis

 Based on Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, there is a moderate correlation between the number of pics and profile views. According to the Lovoo study, the more profile pics that a user had, the more views they got on their profile. There was a spike in views when users had 15 to 27 pics on their profile ( at 27 pics there was a height of 30,000 views). When the number of pics are lower, there is a major decrease in view, ranging from  1,000 - 9,000 views

How do the profile characteristics of  “age”, “counts_fans”, “counts_pictures”, “lang_count” and “country” influence the number of counts_kisses (or likes)?" - Sara 
	
 Profile characteristics have various influences on the number of likes or “counts_kisses” that a user receives. For instance, using Pearson’s correlation, you can see the relationship between “age” and “count’s_kisses” is -0.05753781825924586, indicating a very weak negative correlation. This suggests that as age increases, the number of likes tends to decrease slightly. However, the relationship is so weak that it is likely not significant. Age does not appear to have a meaningful impact on the number of likes. The correlation between “counts_fans” and “counts_kisses” is 0.1255315894084899, indicating a weak positive correlation. This suggests that profiles with more fans may receive slightly more likes, but the effect is very minor. The data also reveals that the top three countries with the highest number of likes are Germany, Switzerland, and Brazil. Additionally, users who speak two languages tend to receive more likes than those who speak only one or more than two.
